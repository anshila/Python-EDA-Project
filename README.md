# Python-EDA-Project
Step 1: Import Python Libraries
Import all libraries which are required for our analysis, such as Data Loading, Statistical analysis, Visualizations, Data Transformations etc.
Step 2: Reading Dataset
Using the read_csv() function, data can be converted to a pandas DataFrame.
Step 3: Analyzing the Data
The main goal of data understanding is to gain general insights about the data, which covers the number of rows and columns, values in the data, datatypes, and Missing values in the dataset.
Step 4: Data Preprocessing
The steps required to go from raw data to a format suitable to input to your ML model. For say a linear/logistic regression model, this would mean the input data needs to be converted to vector format (eg. imputing missing values, one-hot encoding categorical variables, etc). 
Handling Missing Data:
 - Identify and address any missing values in the dataset.
Correcting 'Height' Column:
 - Replace incorrect 'height' data with random numbers between 150 and 180.

Step 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
1. Team Distribution and Percentage Split
Determine the number of employees in each team.
Calculate the percentage split with respect to the total employees.
2. Position Segregation
Categorize employees based on different positions within the company.
3. Age Group Analysis
Identify the age group with the highest number of employees.
4. High-Spending Teams and Positions
Determine the teams and positions where the salary spending is the highest.
5. Correlation between Age and Salary
Investigate if there is any correlation between age and salary.
Represent the correlation visually using appropriate visualizations.

Conclusions
The EDA project provides a thorough understanding of the ABC Company employee dataset. Insights into team distribution, position categorization, age group patterns, and salary spending are key outcomes. The correlation analysis between age and salary offers valuable insights into potential trends. This report aims to guide decision-makers in making informed decisions about team composition, resource allocation, and employee satisfaction.
